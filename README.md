A Lightweight Forum Created in ASP.NET

[![Build Status][travis-image]][travis-url]

I created COSMOS as a fun project to improve my ASP.NET, C# and SQL Database skills.
This project allowed me to practice building full-stack applications in which I could sharpen both my front-end and back-end development skills.

## Name
I chose the name COSMOS because I enjoy astronomy and refering to yourself as a cosmonaut sounds 10x more badass than an astronuat. And, no, my capslock does not perieodically get stuck. You can not be a successful startup with predictable spelling.
